## About Laravel

<p text-indent="20px"> Laravel 5.4 continues the improvements made in Laravel 5.3 by adding support for Markdown based emails and notifications, the Laravel Dusk browser automation and testing framework, Laravel Mix, Blade "components" and "slots", route model binding on broadcast channels, higher order messages for Collections, object-based Eloquent events, job-level "retry" and "timeout" settings, "realtime" facades, improved support for Redis Cluster, custom pivot table models, middleware for request input trimming and cleaning, and more. In addition, the entire codebase of the framework was reviewed and refactored for general cleanliness. </p>
