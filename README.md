## About Laravel

<p text-indent="20px"> Laravel 5.4 continues the improvements made in Laravel 5.3 by adding support for Markdown based emails and notifications, the Laravel Dusk browser automation and testing framework, Laravel Mix, Blade "components" and "slots", route model binding on broadcast channels, higher order messages for Collections, object-based Eloquent events, job-level "retry" and "timeout" settings, "realtime" facades, improved support for Redis Cluster, custom pivot table models, middleware for request input trimming and cleaning, and more. In addition, the entire codebase of the framework was reviewed and refactored for general cleanliness. </p>

## Climax
<p> Unfortunately in the Blogger Profile blade, i had a hard time getting the blogs of a certain blogger. I used hasMany and belongsTo relationship to get the data i want. But only the belongsTo worked, I could get the owner of each blog but not the blogger's blogs in the blogger blade. I dont know why and I've search the problem over the internet specifically on the Stackoverflow but I couldn't get an answer. For this, I would like to apologize for not finishing my project 100%. </p>

<p> I would like to thank sir Romack Natividad not only for patiently teaching us but also for giving me the opportunity to develop this web application. I've gain a lot of knowledge and let out my creativity in the process. We've had a hard time, honestly, but it's all for us. For us to push through the web developing career. Laravel is just one of the many frameworks we have to love no matter what, and we are ready to accept all the challenges we will encounter </p>
